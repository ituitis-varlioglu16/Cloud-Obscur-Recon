1. A lack of technological and operational standards needed to guide safe and consistent performance of UAVs

Despite popular belief, the military does not have automated recognition or computer vision algorithms sufficient to
infer what is happening in a given image or feed. Even if there were a perfect target recognition algorithm, tracker,
or identifier, there is always the matter of context. Context tells you why the man is digging on the side of the road.
Is it a bomb or just a new drainage ditch? Understanding context is a very human-intensive process.(source 1)

2. A lack of comprehensive government regulations

The enormous amount of people and processes involved in drone operations creates an environment that increases mistakes,
dilutes accountability, and promotes ineffective decision making. Overworked, stressed pilots operating in human factors
abominations while multiple different agencies, analysts, troops, and commanders are all providing information without context,
can lead to some serious mistakes. When these happen, who is to blame?(source 2)

3.Vulnerabilities in the command and control of UAV operations.(eg. GPS-jamming, hacking, and the potential for cyberterrorism)

So far, most hacking incidents of commercial drones have been tests to identify security issues and rectify them, not exploit
them. However, as long as weaknesses exist and their systems are exposed, hackers will find creative ways to compromise or
take control of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This makes drone flight controls, sensors, imagery, video, data, and
base stations vulnerable to attack. Those weaknesses pose a threat to safety, data security, and privacy.(source 3)
